What the project does:

This project is a game for a user to play within a browser.  By pressing the keys on the keyboard,
you can guess what the computer has selected from an "alphabet" array (a-z).  The user is given 10 guesses to find the computer's random choice.  A wins and losses record is located within the browser, as well as a record of past guesses.  If an incorrect key is pressed, the user will be prompted but no guess will be subtracted.  

Why the project is useful:

The project is useful because it gives a user a fun, entertaining game that doesn't require downloads to play at any time in the browser.

How users can get started with the project:

All a user has to do to play the game is to select a key from their keyboard which will count as their first guess.
